Shellcodes are pieces of machine code which run can independently. 
* They are mostly used in Hacking but its applications are not limited to it. 
* They can be used as functions which perform specific task just like plugin.
* In managed (.Net) or interpreted environment, they can be used to execute performance critical tasks.
* They sre generated by JIT Compilers which compile high level languages to machine code when needed.

Normally shellcodes are written in assembly language and then compiles using NASM, but there are techniques which allow shellcode development through C/C++.
